# This file is intentionally left empty. All calls to this bundle will be delegated to the parent bundle messages
# (which contains english messages).
#
# Not providing this bundle would cause the bundle for the default locale to take precedence over the base bundle.
# If the default locale is not english but one, for which a resource bundle exists (e.g. russian), the english texts
# would never be returned.
